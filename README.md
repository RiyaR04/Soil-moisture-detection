# Soil-moisture-detection
A soil moisture monitoring system using an STM32F4 microcontroller. It reads moisture levels via an ADC-connected sensor, indicates moisture status with LEDs, and conserves power by controlling sensor power. The readings are periodically sent to a Bluetooth-enabled device for remote monitoring.
